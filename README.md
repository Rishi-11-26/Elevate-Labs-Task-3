SQL for Data Analysis
# SQL Data Analysis Project: Shipping Ecommerce

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a shipping ecommerce dataset using SQL queries. The objective is to extract insights, perform data aggregation, and demonstrate the use of SQL features such as SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOINS, subqueries, aggregate functions, views, and indexes.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `shipping_ecommerce` with the following columns:
- Customer_care_calls
- Customer_rating
- Prior_purchases
- Discount_offered
- Weight_in_gms
- Warehouse_block
- Mode_of_Shipment
- Product_importance
- Gender
- Class

## Key Features
- Filtering and sorting data with WHERE and ORDER BY
- Aggregation using GROUP BY with SUM, AVG, COUNT
- Joining data with INNER JOIN (self-join example)
- Using subqueries for advanced filtering
- Creating SQL views for reusable analysis
- Query optimization with indexes

## How to Run
1. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
2. Run the provided SQL script file (`shipping_ecommerce_analysis.sql`) to execute all queries.
3. View the results in your SQL client or export as needed.

## Deliverables
- SQL script file containing all queries.
- Screenshots or exports of query outputs (to be submitted separately).

## Tools Used
- MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (depending on your environment)
